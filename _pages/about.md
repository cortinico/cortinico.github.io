# Hi there üëã  I'm Nicola

I'm an **Android Engineer** an **OpenSource Lover** and a **Runner**.

## Android

I'm working in the [<i class="fab fa-react"></i> React Native core team](https://reactnative.dev/) as an Android Engineer, building one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework, used by billions of users worldwide. My main focus it to provide top-notch developer tools & libraries to support the React Native ecosystem. I'm fully committed to deliver the best quality software and to foster a healthy community around React Native.

Previously, I spent some time building Android Infrastructure at [<i class="fab fa-spotify"></i> Spotify](https://spotify.com/) in Stockholm, Sweden üá∏üá™ and at [<i class="fab fa-yelp"></i> Yelp](https://yelp.com/) in Hamburg, Germany üá©üá™.

## Community, OSS & Public Speaking

I love to **build meaningful communities** around me, either online or in real life.

Since 2020, I'm a member of the [GDE (Google Developer Expert) program](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-nicola-corti) in the Android category. I enjoy connecting developers around me and I had the opportunity to build and support the following communities:

* [The GDG (Google Developer Group) chapter in Pisa](https://gdgpisa.it/)
* [The Kotlin User Group in Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-User-Group-Hamburg/)
* [The GDG (Google Developer Group) Android chapter in Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/STHLM-Android/)

I have a serious thing for Open Source Software (OSS) üêß. Checkout my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github profile](https://github.com/cortinico) to see my projects and get in touch if you wish to collaborate or get some mentoring on how to start with OSS.

I also really enjoy public speaking and sharing my experiences. You can checkout some of my slides and videos in the [talks page](/talks). Are you looking for speakers? I'm happy to travel and come to your meetup/conference! Just send me a [mail](mailto:corti.nico@gmail.com).

## Running

In my free time, I love to run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I had the pleasure to run the Pisa Marathon in 2019, 2021 and the London Marathon in 2021.

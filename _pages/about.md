# Hi there 👋  I'm Nicola

I'm an **Android Engineer** an **OpenSource Lover** and a **Runner**.

## Android

I'm working in the [<i class="fab fa-react"></i> React Native core team](https://reactnative.dev/) as an Android Engineer, building one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework, used by billions of users worldwide. My main focus it to provide top-notch developer tools & libraries to support the React Native ecosystem. I'm fully committed to deliver the best quality software and to foster a healthy community around React Native.

Previously, I spent some time building Android Infrastructure at [<i class="fab fa-spotify"></i> Spotify](https://spotify.com/) in Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪 and at [<i class="fab fa-yelp"></i> Yelp](https://yelp.com/) in Hamburg, Germany 🇩🇪.

## Community, OSS & Public Speaking

I love to **build meaningful communities** around me, either online or in real life.

Since 2020, I'm a member of the [GDE (Google Developer Expert) program](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-nicola-corti) in the Kotlin category. I enjoy connecting developers around me and I had the opportunity to build and support the following communities:

* [The GDG (Google Developer Group) chapter in Pisa](https://gdgpisa.it/)
* [The Kotlin User Group in Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-User-Group-Hamburg/)
* [The GDG (Google Developer Group) Android chapter in Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/STHLM-Android/)

I have a serious thing for Open Source Software (OSS) 🐧. Checkout my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github profile](https://github.com/cortinico) to see my projects and get in touch if you wish to collaborate or get some mentoring on how to start with OSS.

I also really enjoy public speaking and sharing my experiences. You can checkout some of my slides and videos in the [talks page](/talks). Are you looking for speakers? I'm happy to travel and come to your meetup/conference! Just send me a [mail](mailto:corti.nico@gmail.com).

## Running

In my free time, I love to run 🏃‍♂️. I had the pleasure to run the Pisa Marathon in 2019, 2021 and the London Marathon in 2021. If you want to follow my run journeys, make sure to don't miss my [<i class="fab fa-instagram"></i> Instagram](https://instagram.com/cortinico) or [<i class="fab fa-strava"></i> Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/20762958) profile.

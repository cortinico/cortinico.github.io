A couple of months ago, I had the honor to be one of the organizers of the first [GDG DevFest Pisa 0.1](https://devfest.gdgpisa.it/), a community conference in Pisa (Tuscany 🇮🇹) all about Android, Cloud, Web and Google technologies.

After this experience, I can say that organizing a conference is something that every developer should experience once in their life.

I decided to collect all the lessons learned, in a series of medium posts for the future conference organizers.

[Part 1 - The Idea](https://medium.com/@cortinico/how-to-organize-your-community-conference-part-1-c4d61927dbf5) - How our conference was born.

[Part 2 - The Environment](https://medium.com/@cortinico/how-to-organize-your-community-conference-part-2-35bcff56276a) - Why it plays a fundamental role in your conference success.

[Part 3 - The People](https://medium.com/@cortinico/how-to-organize-your-community-conference-part-3-589d2bceecee) - How to engage the right crowds to your conference.

I hope you can find those tips and tricks useful and you can find inspiration for your next **community conference**.
